# Installation of Blender addons
Pack the *.py* and *.blend* files in the addon directory into a zip file. Open Blender->Edit->Preferences->Add-ons->Install and select the zip file. The GUI should appear in the side panel in the viewport. Make sure to use the Viewport Shading view set to Rendered to see the final results.
